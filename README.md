Software requirements: Oracle 10g, SQL*PLUS

SQL*Plus is a command line interface tool which is used to access Oracle databases. 
After installing Oracle 10g, you can find the SQL*PLUS command line using the following path:
C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\10.2.0\server\BIN

After launching it, enter username and password that you was set in the installation process. 
Normally we use system as username and the password during installation can be anything.
